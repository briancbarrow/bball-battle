BBALL BATTLE
=======
BBall Battle is an app that allows you to compare stats between two NBA players.

The app compares both players and then assigns a winner by giving them a yellow Star.

The user only needs to type in a player name in each input box. Exact spelling is required so there is a datalist dropdown provided as the user types.

### Next Steps
* Make dropdown datalist scrollable
* Assign routes to player comparisons to allow for shareability
* Add Tweet button that tweets a screenshot of the comparisons
* Add section showing most frequently compared players
* Allow user to select which stats will be used in comparison
